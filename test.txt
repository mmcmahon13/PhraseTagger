Teamsters strike Hertz ahead of Chicago convention . Three hundred employees of car rental giant Hertz Corp. went out on strike just one week before the Democratic National Convention begins here . More than 20,000 people are expected to descend on Chicago next week for the Aug. 26 - 29 convention . Those wanting to rent Hertz cars will be able to do so despite the strike , said a spokesman for Hertz , the world 's largest car rental firm and a unit of Ford Motor Co. Hertz managers were staffing customer service counters , courtesy buses and vehicle service areas left abandoned Monday by members of Teamsters Local 781 , said Hertz 's Joe Russo . If needed , Hertz was prepared to maintain interim staffing through the convention at the affected locations at O'Hare and Midway airports , as well as two downtown offices , he said . " Our guess is the union saw some opportunity to put some pressure on Hertz with the Democratic National Convention in town and we fully anticipated that , " Russo said by telephone from Hertz headquarters in Park Ridge , N.J.T he 300 employees have been working without a contract since December 1995 . Negotiations apparently stumbled over work rules and the two sides are not far apart , Russo said . " The strike came as a bit of a surprise yesterday because we thought this was an awfully attractive package , " he said . The union could not be reached for comment .

Greek PM calls early elections on September 22 . Greek Socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Thursday called snap general elections for September 22 , saying he sought a mandate to bolster the country 's defences against rival Turkey and revive the economy . " I will visit tomorrow the president of the republic to request the parliament 's dissolution and ask for elections to be held on Sunday , September 22 , " Simitis told reporters after chairing a special cabinet meeting . Elections were originally scheduled for October next year but Simitis said he needed a public mandate to push Greece closer to its European Union partners and to strengthen national defence to deal with any Turkish threats on Greek territory . " Our country must take all necessary measures and decisions so it does not become marginalised in the European Union 's political and economic integration , " Simitis said . " The strengthening of Greece is a necessary prerequisite for effective diplomacy and defence against Turkish designs , " he added . Simitis said snap elections were vital to allow the new government to deal with the problems facing Greece without the distraction of an extended campaign period ahead of a 1997 poll . " We do n't need small steps but leaps ahead , " he said . " I consider that only a government with a public mandate can deal effectively with challenges of the 21st century . " Simitis , 60 , took over as premier from the dying socialist PASOK party founder Andreas Papandreou in January and then won the PASOK presidency in June after Papandreou 's death . The conservative opposition New Democracy party accused Simitis on Thursday of lying to the Greek people because he had stated during the congress that he would not call an early poll . Analysts said Simitis had felt that , if elections were held as scheduled next year , he would pay the political cost of unpopular measures such as spending cuts in public services and below - inflation pay rises . His finance minister , Alexandros Papadopoulos , is in the final stages of putting together next year 's budget , which includes cuts of $ 1.2 billion in state spending and the restructuring of public companies to boost growth . Papadopoulos has warned Greeks the country is still a long way from meeting the criteria needed to join European Monetary Union ( EMU ) in 1999 and that in the next two years they must make sacrifices to slash inflation and a towering public debt . Inflation was running at a rate of 8.6 percent year - on - year in June -- the highest by far in the European Union -- and the public debt was still well over 100 per cent of Greek GDP. . The EMU target is to slash the debt to 60 percent of GDP and inflation to about two points above the average inflation of the three best performing EU members . " Papadopoulos and Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou were the ones who pushed the hardest for early elections , " a government official told Reuters . Simitis may also feel forced to resort to foreign borrowing or to imposing new taxes to fund a $ 10 billion weapons purchase in the next five years so that Greece can deter any Turkish territorial designs . Opinion polls due to appear in Athens newspapers next week are expected to show PASOK with a slight lead over New Democracy . 
Analysts offer mixed advice to Brit Gas . The jury is still out among analysts whether British Gas should reject or accept the final Ofgas proposals for a new TransCo pricing regime . Those in favour of accepting argue the utility should forget about regulation for the moment and devote its energy to fighting increased competition and prepare for its planned split - up . " Following the easing of the Ofgas proposals the British Gas board should accept them at the earliest possibility and get on with their business , " said Irene Himona at SG Strauss Turnbull . But BZW 's Daniel Martin said British Gas should not give in as it has good reasons to believe it would find the Monopolies and Merger Commission ( MMC ) on its side . The MMC will vet the Ofgas proposals if British Gas deems them unacceptable . British Gas has until October 7 to decide . " I advice them ( British Gas ) to reject , " said Martin . Ofgas is propoing that TransCo cut its charges to gas suppliers by 20 percent in 1997 and by 2.5 percent in the following four years . The watchdog had initially demanded a one - off price cut of 20 to 28 percent and a drop of five percent in subsequent years . Ofgas arrived at its proposals by employing a new method , assuming adjusted depreciation rather than full depreciation of TransCo 's assets . " There is no precedent for that . It is a new thing and no other regulator has ever tried that . It is worth a try at the MMC , " said Martin . British Gas said earlier it wanted further talks with Ofgas , but director general Clare Spottiswoode said only details were still open for negotiation . She said she had taken a slightly more lenient stance in her final proposals after having received new data from British Gas . Another reason to soften the proposals was to prevent accusations that she aimed to mend any false generosity in the past . Analysts , however , agreed that the final review had remained harsh overall , probably forcing British Gas to trim its 1997 dividend to around 10 pence from 14.50 pence in 1995 . Some analysts predict a cut in the 1996 interim pay - out . -- Hans de Jongh , London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 
U.S. crop survey supports grains prices . A survey that found slow progress in the U.S. corn ( maize ) crop supported world benchmark grain prices in the Chicago futures pits on Wednesday . Elsewhere , August holidays continued to subdue activity in the commodity markets . Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) soybean and corn futures were both higher early on reports from a U.S. crop tour indicating progress lagging far behind normal in the eastern U.S. corn belt , traders said . Crop scouts on the ProFarmer tour in Ohio and Indiana said potential corn yields were below last year 's tour estimate . They also said the soybean pod count was below the level of a year ago . Wheat was slightly lower on a technical break but was underpinned by the gains in corn and soybeans plus unsettled weather in U.S. and Canadian spring wheat areas . Corn was soon 1-3/4 to three cents per bushel higher , with September up three at $ 3.65 - 1/4 . Wheat was unchanged to 1/2 cent per bushel lower , with September unchanged at $ 4.54 - 1/2 .

Bangladesh lawmakers protest police raid on campus . Bangladeshi opposition lawmakers walked out of parliament on Wednesday in protest against police raids on Dhaka University residential halls where violence erupted between student groups , parliamentary sources said . Members of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) and fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami staged the walkout after they were refused permission to open an unscheduled debate on the campus clashes , the sources said . Home Minister Rafiqul Islam told the house in a statement later there was a " sinister design " to create chaos in the country and destabilise the new government . Police denied any firing on the campus but said they had used teargas after violence broke out between the Chhatra League , the student wing of ruling Awami League , and Jatyatabadi Chhatradal ( JCD ) of the BNP. Islam said police resorted to action only after JCD activists attacked them with guns . He said the JCD protesters were preventing students from attending class . The JCD called a strike on campus after their supporters were driven out by rivals from a residential hall on Tuesday . Hospital sources said Shahiduddin Chowdhury Ani , the president of JCD , was injured and admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital . The JCD supporters , angered by the incident , set fire to the office of the provost of a university hall . Police said they then raided university dormitories to flush out fighting students and found four guns . Two JCD students had been arrested , they said . Nearly 20 students and one policeman had been injured since Monday in sporadic clashes between the rival student groups , police said .
